This code is a Python implementation of a 3D ASCII art animation using pygame. It generates a rotating torus shape and displays it as ASCII characters on the screen, creating a mesmerizing effect. The torus is created by calculating the 3D coordinates of points on its surface and projecting them onto a 2D plane for display.

Here's a brief description for a GitHub repository for this code:
